# Unit Circle

An Upsilon external application that shows an interactive unit circle.
The colors used for the interface are based on the [`Arc Dark`](https://github.com/lolocomotive/Omega-Arc-Dark) theme.

## Screenshot

_At the time of writing the simulator was still compiling so no screenshot for now._

## To-do list

- [ ] Axes
  - [ ] X and Y axis (`cos` and `sin`)
  - [ ] Add know values (`1/2`, `âˆš2/2`, `âˆš3/2`, etc...)
  - [ ] Dotted lines linking the X and Y axis to the angle
- [ ] Angle selector
  - [ ] Refactor the angle text drawing (to support selected version)
  - [ ] Full line going from origin to selected angle
- [ ] Selected angle menu
  - [ ] Cosine of the angle
  - [ ] Sine of the angle
  - [ ] Tangent of the angle
  - [ ] Angle in degrees
  - [ ] Angle in radians
  - [ ] Angle in gradians
- [ ] Maybe: Zoom in and out (zooming in will cause other angles to show like `Ï€/12`)

> ðŸ’¡ If I find the time to do it I will also make an internal version of the application. If this happens I'll open a pull request on Upsilon repository and hopefully it'll become a preinstaller application.
